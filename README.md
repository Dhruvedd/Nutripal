NutriPal functions on integrating a Nutrition API with GPT-4 and getting nutritional information from food items and using that to provide personalized dietary recommendations. Simply set your nutritional goals, and keep adding the food items that you have eaten today along with serving sizes. Example inputs: "Pizza 50g", "Chicken curry 150g", "Dal 200g", etc. The progress section represents the progress you have made towards your daily goal that you have set, using the data from the nutritional information of the food items that you inputed. For greater insights use the Nutrition Information tab to input any food item of any serving size to get nutritional data. NutriPal AI utilizes the data about your dietary goals and your progress towards them and give you personalizes dietary recommendations.

Update: NutriPal has become much slower as a result of the Nutrition API becoming much slower. Protein and Calorific information has been removed since they became premium features for the Nutrition API.
